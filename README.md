# üìö E-Book Management System

The **E-Book Management System** is a Spring Boot application designed to manage eBooks and their associated metadata. It allows users to upload eBook PDFs and cover images to an **AWS S3 bucket**, stores metadata in **AWS DynamoDB**, and supports background processing via **SQS**, with **SNS** notifications to subscribers when a new eBook is created.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### ‚ûï New eBook Upload Workflow:

1. User uploads a new eBook via REST API.
2. The application stores the file(s) in **Amazon S3**.
3. eBook metadata is saved in **Amazon DynamoDB**.
4. A message is sent to an **SQS Queue** for background tasks (e.g., indexing, logging).
5. Once processing is complete, an **SNS Notification** is published to subscribers (e.g., email notification about the new eBook).
